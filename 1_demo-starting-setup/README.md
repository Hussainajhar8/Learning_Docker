To deploy this application, follow these steps:
1.	Install Docker on your machine if you haven't already.
2.	Build the Docker image for the application by running the following command in the terminal: docker build -t docker-complete . This will create a Docker image with the name "docker-complete".
3.	Run the Docker image to create a container: docker run -p 3000:3000 -d docker-complete This will start the application in a container and map the container's port 3000 to your machine's port 3000.
4.	The application will now be running on http://localhost:3000. You can access it from your web browser.

Here is a brief explanation of what the code does:
•	The application is built using the Express web framework.
•	The app.get route handles a GET request to the root path of the application and sends a response with the message "Hi there!".
•	The connectToDatabase function is a dummy function that returns a promise that resolves after 1 second. This is just to simulate the process of connecting to a database.
•	The app.listen method starts the server and listens for incoming requests on port 3000.

The Dockerfile is a configuration file that specifies how the Docker image should be built. It starts from the node:14 base image and then copies the necessary files, installs the dependencies, and exposes the necessary ports. The CMD command specifies the command to run when the container is started.
The package.json file contains metadata about the application, such as its name and dependencies.
