To deploy this Python application, follow these steps:

1.	Install Docker on your machine if you haven't already.
2.	Build the Docker image for the application by running the following command in the terminal: docker build -t rng-app . This will create a Docker image with the name "rng-app".
3.	Run the Docker image to create a container: docker run -it rng-app This will start the container and run the rng.py script. The -it flag allows you to interact with the container's terminal.
4.	The script will prompt you to enter a minimum and maximum number. Enter the desired numbers and press Enter.
5.	The script will output a random number between the minimum and maximum numbers that you entered.

Here is a brief explanation of what the code does:

•	The script generates a random number between a minimum and maximum number that the user enters.

•	If the maximum number is less than the minimum number, the script prints an error message and exits.

The Dockerfile is a configuration file that specifies how the Docker image should be built. It starts from the python base image and then copies the necessary files to the /app directory in the container. The CMD command specifies the command to run when the container is started.
